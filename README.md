## Design
In the realm of the Gamers Insight Blog, our design philosophy is centered around crafting a sleek and contemporary user interface that spotlights gaming insights. Our inspiration springs from the immersive realms of video games, aiming to deliver a visually captivating experience to users. Our primary goal is to facilitate easy navigation, discovery, and engagement within a vast collection of gaming articles.

We aspire to create an environment where users can delve into the intricate world of gaming, collecting insider information before embarking on their gaming adventures. Whether it's sharing tips, uncovering cheat codes, or simply being a part of our dynamic blog community, Gamers Insight welcomes everyone to join the gaming conversation. It's your portal to the gaming universe, where insights and camaraderie await!

### Design Choices
Our design choices were carefully crafted with gamers in mind. We've created an environment that captures the essence of the gaming community.

### Colour
Our decision to adopt the 60-30-10 rule in our UI design is driven by its ability to create a cohesive and engaging user experience. This approach guarantees consistency by allocating 60% of our color palette to the dominant color, fostering brand recognition and trust. The 30% dedicated to the secondary color enables us to strike a visual balance, allowing for variations in content, headers, and backgrounds without overwhelming users. The remaining 10% allocated to the accent color serves to highlight interactive elements and calls to action, though we recommend choosing a contrasting shade for improved visibility and user engagement. This strategy ensures that our web application not only looks appealing but also functions effectively, guiding users to key elements while maintaining a harmonious and dependable design.
![Mockup image](/docs/color-palette.png)
**Dominant (60%):** 

Our choice of a deep blue shade, represented by #13112E as the dominant color, reflects our commitment to creating a unique and immersive gaming experience. This rich hue serves as the foundation for our web application's design, providing a dark and mysterious backdrop that resonates with the gaming community. It symbolizes trust and stability, inviting users to explore a world where they can delve into gaming insights.

**Secondary (30%):** 

The secondary color, also #13112E, is an intentional choice to maintain visual harmony and hierarchy throughout our design. It complements the dominant color with subtle variations, reinforcing the immersive atmosphere we aim to create. This choice ensures that our users can navigate seamlessly through our content, discovering gaming insights with ease.

**Accent (10%):** 

While it might seem unconventional, our selection of #13112E as the accent color carries a unique significance. We've deliberately chosen to keep a consistent blue theme throughout our UI, aligning with the essence of the gaming world. The accent color's role is to draw attention to interactive elements, such as buttons and links, creating a sense of cohesion and enhancing usability within our gaming community.

In short, our choice of colors isn't just about how things look; it's about creating a cool and welcoming place for gamers. We used a dark background as the main color (60%) to make the gaming experience more exciting. The blue colors we picked show that we get what gamers like, and we're focused on making a design that gamers will really like.

## Methodology

The Gamers Insight project follows a methodology inspired by agile principles, fostering collaboration, flexibility, and gradual development. The outlined approach has guided the project's evolution:

### Agile Project Management with GitHub Projects
To streamline project management, GitHub Projects is employed as a central hub. User stories and tasks are structured as GitHub issues, creating an organized workflow. The GitHub project board serves as a visual representation, tracking progress effectively.

### User Stories as GitHub Issues
Transforming user stories into GitHub issues captures user-centric functionalities. These issues interlink with respective user stories, simplifying access to criteria, tasks, and discussions.

### Bug Tracking for Seamless Development
Bugs uncovered during development are documented as GitHub issues, offering insights into each bug's characteristics, impact, and reproduction steps. By hyperlinking these issues in the README.md, users can stay updated on bug resolutions and contribute insights.

### Iterative Development Approach
The Gamers Insight project adheres to an iterative development approach, facilitating continuous enhancements within a predefined timeline. Despite its condensed schedule, the project accommodates future iterations and expansions.

### Future Backlog and Progress
The project board efficiently manages user stories, with the "Not started" column representing upcoming iterations. This backlog previews user stories set for subsequent development phases.

Emphasizing that the project timeline is expedited, the iterative approach maintains adaptability, enabling ongoing refinements and improvements aligned with evolving user needs.
