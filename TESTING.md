**Throughout the game development process, I relied on Google Developer Tools to experiment with different elements and phases of the game. Additionally, I leveraged the console section in Chrome Dev Tools to test JavaScript code and address any problems or glitches that occurred in the code.**

## **Automated Testing**

The W3C validator was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the website and the STYLESHEET in css file, PEP8 was used for validating the python files and code. JSHint was used to validate all my javascript files used for this project. Click on the below links to have the full validation. No error was found.
